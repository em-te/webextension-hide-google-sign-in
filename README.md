# ![appicon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/em-te/webextension-hide-google-sign-in/main/icon_24.png) WebExtension: Hide G Sign In

## Introduction
Delays loading the 'Google Sign In' code on non-Google websites for your privacy.

## Description

This extension hides the "Google Sign In" box on all webpages so that it doesn't cover up vital screen space.

By default all websites (except websites on the Google domain) will have the box hidden.

To add a website's domain to the whitelist, click on the toolbar icon when on the website.

Note: to prevent interference with the rest of the website, this extension will actually pause loading the "Google Sign In" code. It will resume when you click the toolbar icon or if it was previously added to the whitelist.

## Privacy

For your privacy, this extension uses "declarativeNetRequest" so that this extension cannot read your personal data.
